# Covid-19 Simulation 

A simulation that attempts to model the spread of a disease in a population.

You can modify many of the parameters and you can model what will happen if some actions are taken to limit the spread.   

This is a contribution to the 'Hack the crisis' hackathon (https://www.hackthecrisis.se). Due to the limited time, the UI and code quality is quite poor.
